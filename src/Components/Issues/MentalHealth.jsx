          The issue of mental health is not an easy conversation, but we need to
          press harder for resources to help residents of our community with our
          growing mental health needs. As community members face mental health
          needs in greater numbers, resources, treatment, and support do not
          meet our current mental health care crisis. I will work toward
          bringing those resources into our community to help those in need. In
          addition to accessing assistance for individuals with mental health
          needs, I will also look deeper into programs that take innovative
          approaches with proven success. Such programs include:

              The expansion of the Crisis Assistance Response and Engagement
              (CARE) teams pilot into all wards across the city. Individuals
              experiencing a mental health crisis are helped by these teams when
              911 is called. The team, made up of paramedics, mental health
              clinicians, and sometimes a CPD Officer are there to de-escalate a
              situation, referrals and transportation to community services, and
              to follow-up after 1, 7, and 30 days.

              A program in L.A. employs a “street psychiatrist” who brings
              treatment directly to the affected homeless patients in the
              street, as a part of Homeless Outreach and Mobile Engagement
              (HOME). This doctor establishes a relationship built on trust, and
              from there treatment and housing can begin. <br />
